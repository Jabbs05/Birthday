HAPPY BIRTHDAY NAJIBAHHHHHH!!!!!!
I was the first to wish you today🤭🤭
Durhhh
Who wan do am first
Congrats on your new age toyosi
You no longer have 1 in your age<br>
No longer a teenager 🤣<br>

Many More years of happiness and joy and that money you've been craving for....starting to resemble rich aunty small small(Mifrah go ball🙂‍↔)<br>
God didnt sprinkle an Arabian man but an offa man so yayyyy🌚<br>
It has been a fun year can't lie and you're a really great friend and person irrespective of whatever you tell yourself <br>
Less meetups and way more busy with life but still made time for each other when needed and I'm Glad could rely on you for that if not anything<br>
Maybe we'll fix up this year
Been nice getting to watch you grown with bisola
You'd deny it but you're better than you were a year ago and I'm proud of you for that
You're flawed but who isn't 
Even me sef(I'm human....suprisngly)
Grateful for the bants and I'll always be there for your late night rants and spend the money in your akant....mic drop(Kanye has nothing on me joor....see bars🤣🤣)
<br>
Anyways this is getting long and you're a lazy reader
Your reading list shows it no offense 
(Weird Malik laughing noises with tongue out)
What I'm trying to say is you're an amazing person and you deserve nothing but the best in this life and I wish nothing else for you besides that and glad to see surely but slowly you're getting there
And I'll keep on trying to help you achieve it anyway humanely and inhumanity possible(You already know)🤭
So glad you wanted to learn chess that fateful day in 2018 and texted me🤭
That jack grifoo obsessed little girl is growing up to be a strong independent beautiful and amazing woman right before my eyes
Glad I'm witnessing it🥹(wipes off singular tear drop running down the side of my face)
It's been an amazing six years
This would be the fourth year in a row I'm wishing you 
Cheers to me wishing you for many many more birthdays and years as you live🥂
Hope you have a wonderful day najibah
Love you my guy 💕

If you go left, It will go left<br>
If you go right, It will go right<br>
If you run, It will run<br>
If you hide, it will locate you.<br>
No matter what you do, May you not escape<br>
what's coming for you in this life cos they are<br>
harvests of what you have sown<br>
InshaAllah!!<br>

YOURS SINCERELY AND FAITHFULLY<br>

Updated it because change is permanent which is why you'll keep on Changing for the better🎂
