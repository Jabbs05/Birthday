    HAPPY BIRTHDAY NAJIBAHHHHHH!!!!!! <br>
    I was the first to wish you today🤭🤭 <br>
    Tee hee <br>
    Congrats on your new age busola
       <br>
    Many More years of happiness and joy and that money you've been craving for<br>
    Maybe sprinkle in an Arabian man here or there🌚<br>
    It has been a fun year can't lie and you're a really great friend and person irrespective of whatever you tell yourself 
    You're flawed but who isn't <br>
    If you weren't flawed you wouldn't be human so in the actual sense you're human than us all🫵🏾(This is more trululu than delulu) <br>
    So many memories to look back on that make me grateful for having you as a friend<br>
    From random days we go for night class <br>
    To days we bought suya and ice cream together(We really should continue that next year🤭🌚) <br>
    To days you just feel like dragging me out then we end up walking to park then easy and quiet💀 to your hostel and you vent to me and we maybe get suya or popcorn <br>
    To the days you sat in front of your hostel with me when I was phoneless to talk till literally 11pm even though you kinda hated it(I really appreciate you for that😗) <br>
    To the days you gave me your laptop to watch movies or just have it with me in general <br>
    Days you bought food for me or was it day(wo yo sha buy food for me sha) <br>
    Anyways this is getting long and you're a lazy reader.........
    Your reading list shows it no offense nkikikki(these are weird laughter noises)<br>   
    But <br>
    What I'm trying to say is you're an amazing person and you deserve nothing but the best in this life and I wish nothing else for you besides that <br> 
    And I'll try and help you achieve it anyway humanely and inhumanity possible(You already know)🤭 <br>
    So glad you wanted to learn chess that fateful day in 2018 and texted me🤭 <br>
    That jack grifoo obsessed little girl is growing up to be a strong independent beautiful and amazing woman right before my eyes <br>
    Glad I'm witnessing it🥹(wipes off singular tear drop running down the side of my face) 
    <br>
    It's been an amazing five years
    <br>
    Cheers to more birthdays and years🥂
    <br>
    Hope you have a wonderful rest of your day najibah
    <br>
    Love you × 3000😙💕
